# Todo App Project

A simple React-based Todo App that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. The app supports adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete, with persistent storage using `localStorage`.

## Features
- Add new todos.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks.
- Filter tasks by **All**, **Completed**, or **Open**.
- Persistent storage via `localStorage`.

## What I Learned
While building this app, I learned:
1. **React Basics**
   - Managing state with `useState`.
   - Handling side effects with `useEffect`.
2. **Component Architecture**
   - Structuring components (`Header`, `Tabs`, `TodoInput`, `TodoList`, `TodoCard`).
   - Passing props between components for communication.
3. **LocalStorage**
   - Storing and retrieving data to make the app persistent.
4. **Array Methods**
   - Using methods like `map`, `filter`, and `findIndex` for managing tasks.
5. **CSS and UI**
   - Styling components and creating a responsive layout.
